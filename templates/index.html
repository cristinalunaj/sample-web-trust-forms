                  Thank you very much for your cooperation!
                  <br>
                  This is an anonymous survey that would take <strong>no more than 20 minutes</strong> to complete.
                  We are a team of multinational researchers <strong> studying the effects of TRUST</strong>
                  during a brief intervention at zero acquaintance.
                  <br>
                  During the survey, you will be <strong>asked about several physical and psychological aspects </strong>of the person that appear in the videos (including attractiveness, emotion, trustworthiness perceived, honesty...) <br>, in which you
                  should give an <strong>answer in the range from -3 (Extremely Negative) to +3 (Extremely Positive)</strong>.
                  <br>
                  It is important that you rate each person in the videos objectively - specifically,
                  <strong>HOW the information is expressed (the behaviour/action)</strong>, and not what it is said (the content of the message).
                  <br>
                  <br> <strong>Final Note!: Fill in JUST ONE FORM, don't use the link again for sending new answers :)</strong>

                  <br> Let's start!

              </p>
